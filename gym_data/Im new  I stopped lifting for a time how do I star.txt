I’m new / I stopped lifting for a time, how do I start?
The Adding Physical Activity Page
has a recommended training path for those who are new or a bit rusty, and we believe this is the simplest way to get back into the groove. If you’re coming back to it after a long time, be prepared for your lifts to have gone down – probably by a lot. Don’t rush it. If your break was short, you can likely just pick up where you last left off if you shave a little weight off of where you’re at.
It may also be appropriate to use an
Intro Week, as described in this EliteFTS article.
