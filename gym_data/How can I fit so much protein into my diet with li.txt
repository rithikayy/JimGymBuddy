How can I fit so much protein into my diet with limited calories?
Easy – Protein only has 4 calories per gram in it. Even a 200g/day protein goal (
which is likely more than enough for most people
) is only 800 calories in total. This leaves plenty of room for carbs and fat.
If you’re having trouble figuring out what to include in your diet, a good place to start is to do a Google search for “high protein foods”. Protein shakes are very commonly used to meet high protein goals conveniently, and
are – no lie – nothing more special than just plain old protein.
Also make sure to click the link above and make sure you’re not trying for a protein goal that is too high to be useful.
