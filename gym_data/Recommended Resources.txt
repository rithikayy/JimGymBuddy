Stronger By Science
One of the driving goals of this wiki is to help fitness enthusiasts separate the wheat from the chaff in the firehose of fitness information on the internet. The unfortunate reality of the fitness industry is that the inexperienced-but-vocal, the well-meaning-but-misguided, algorithm manipulators, click baiters, snake-oil salesmen, flimflammers, hucksters, quacks, phonies, mountebanks, frauds, four-flushers, scoundrels, charlatans, and ne’er-do-wells are often louder and more prominent, and definitely more numerous, than the honest and genuine. The purpose of this page is to combat that by highlighting individuals and organizations that offer high quality training information because they are reputable, experienced, and trustworthy, and do so for free, without using it solely as a vehicle to sucker you into sales.

It’s extremely seductive to think that special pills, powders, and drinks are going to be the key to your health and fitness goals, and that’s exactly why dietary supplements are a hundred billion dollar industry. But it’s also a mostly unregulated industry with minimal oversight, and that’s where Examine comes in. A research aggregator comprised of independent scientists who analyze and review the full body of research on dietary supplements to help separate the effective from the snake oil.
