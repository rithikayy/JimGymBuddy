Am I not getting a good workout if I’m not sweating?
Sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation. When you get hot, sweating is a process your body uses to cool you down. Sweating has no bearing on the quality of your workout, nor is it a measure of how hard you are working. It is simply a reaction to excess body heat.
How much you sweat is determined by your genetics and is influenced by several factors including age, gender, weight, fitness level, medications/drugs, and environmental conditions. No two people will sweat the same way so it is useless to compare your sweating to another’s in an attempt assess your workout.
