What exercises can I do to lose fat in my [body part]?
You cannot target where you lose fat. This is commonly called “spot reduction” and it is a myth. Your genes are responsible for where your body stores fat and where it comes from when losing weight – in a “first on, last off” manner. So if the first place you get fat is your belly, it’s probably going to be the last place to lose it.
