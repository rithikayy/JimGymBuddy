What does the science say about…
Exercise science is an extremely complicated field, even for those who are immersed in it. It’s important to maintain proper perspective when trying to dig into what’s been found through scientific study. Many people try to do this and end up using a deeply flawed approach that only leads to more confusion on their part – especially if they have insufficient background in scientific study.
If your goal is to try to pursue a “science based” approach to your training, it is strongly recommend that you start with the following:
