I’m not sore after my workout. Did I do something wrong?
No. It is a common misconception that if you are not sore after a workout, then you didn’t work out hard enough.
Soreness (aka
DOMS
) is only a sign that your body did something new. It is not an indicator of anything other than novelty, especially the quality or intensity (or lack thereof) of your workout. As your body adapts to new demands, soreness will lessen and maybe even go away completely. Workout quality should be measured by things that can actually be measured and progressed.
