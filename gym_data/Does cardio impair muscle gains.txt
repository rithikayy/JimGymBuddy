Does cardio impair muscle gains?
You may be here because you’ve heard the phrase “cardio kills gains” – Not to worry, this is a meme, and not reality.

of 10 studies found that doing cardio before resistance training had no apparent negative effect on hypertrophy, though it did negatively impact leg strength.
