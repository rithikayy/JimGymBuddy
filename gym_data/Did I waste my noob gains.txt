Did I waste my “noob gains”?
No. “Noob gains” are matter of strength gains as compared to bodyweight. They have nothing to do with how long you’ve been training. If you’ve been eating and training badly, you can still take advantage of them if you get your diet and training routine in check. “Wasting” them is not a thing that can happen. If you have the abilities of a noob, you will improve like a noob.
