My personal trainer gave me a program. Is it any good?
Generally, the answer you will get from the
r/Fitness
community about this question is either “No, it’s terrible” or “
A program from the Wiki
would be better”. The most common criticisms of these “programs” are:
They lack a plan for progression over time, especially in the area of adding weight or otherwise increasing resistance
They are not balanced in which muscle groups they hit, or the volume they hit them in
They are often more geared towards
feeling
difficult, wearing you out, or making you sweat than being based on effective long term training principles
They use unbalanced movements, such as unstable surface training or Bosu balls, which add difficulty but do not have any actual benefit
They make excessive use of complex, multi-stage movements that have artificial difficulty because of unfamiliarity and learning curve
They have an excessive amount of variance in the movements they use from day-to-day and/or week-to-week, sometimes citing “muscle confusion”
They put too much emphasis on machines instead of free weights
They put too much emphasis on isolation movements and not enough on compound movements
They put too much emphasis on circuit, cardio, or high intensity interval type training and not enough on strength training
These are just some of the major red flags to look out for. Not all of them may apply to the routine your trainer gave you.
