Should I workout again if I’m still sore?
Yes. Soreness (technically called
Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness)
is merely a sign that you body isn’t used to what you did. This is fine. You should workout again today, and make sure to properly warm up. You’ll probably feel less sore after working out due to the
repeated bout effect
, and notice that DOMS decreases in intensity as you continue working out consistently.
