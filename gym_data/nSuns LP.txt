As described by u/nSuns, the author of the program, in
the original post
:
This is the program I used to bring my Squat/Bench/Deadlift gym total from 905 to 1215 over the course of about 6 months after a decade of not lifting.
[…]
All of these are pretty self-explanatory, plug in your numbers, then go.

Each day you warm up to the first lift shown, do all the sets in the row for the weight and reps listed, then move onto the second lift. There are two programmed lifts per day, after which you will do accessory work to your needs or desires.
Progression
The work on the main lifts uses a percentage of a Training Max. Initially, this is set to 90% of your 1 Rep Max. After that, one day a week, you do an AMRAP set which determines how much weight you add to your Training Max the next week, as follows:
0-1 Reps:
No increase
2-3 Reps:
Add 5lbs
4-5 Reps:
Add 5-10lbs
> 5 Reps:
Add 10-15lbs
This cycle of testing and modifying your Training Max repeats each week.
