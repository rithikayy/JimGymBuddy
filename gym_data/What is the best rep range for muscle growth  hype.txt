What is the best rep range for muscle growth / hypertrophy?
There’s not a big difference in hypertrophy when comparing rep ranges in the literature.
However,
it seems as if going to or almost to failure stimulates more growth per set
, and the more sets you have, the more growth you get (in both muscle size and strength). The number of sets should be weighed against recovery, which is likely a skill beginner and many intermediate lifters do not have. Because of this, it is best for lifters unfamiliar with how their body responds to training to stick to a tried and true program at first.
