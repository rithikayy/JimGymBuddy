How can I avoid Starvation Mode?
Starvation mode is a myth that was popularized due to the
Minnesota Starvation Experiment
in which subjects were given 50% of their daily calorie intake for months. The result? Well, they lost weight until they had almost no weight left to lose and their bodies simply could not get the calories ANYWHERE. Concisely put: starvation mode happens when you are, quite literally, wasting away. Not when you have a simple caloric deficit. Your body will make up for it with fat stores. That’s what they’re for.
Do not worry about starvation mode
