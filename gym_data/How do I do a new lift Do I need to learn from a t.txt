How do I do a new lift? Do I need to learn from a trainer?
Plenty of people learn good form/mechanics from watching videos, and only use a trainer when they run into a real stumbling block.
If you’re having trouble with any of these, the advice is to still record yourself doing a lift and seeing where you go wrong, as people’s
proprioception
isn’t always as good as they think it is, especially when learning a new skill on their own.
We’ve also compiled Megathreads of commonly recommended instructional videos for the most common lifts on our
Learning and Improving Lifts page
.
ExRx.net’s exercise pages
can also be a great resource, as well as a simple YouTube search.
Also, we have a semi-regular
Instructional Video Megathread
that you can check out.
