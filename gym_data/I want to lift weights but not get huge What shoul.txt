I want to lift weights but not get huge. What should I do?
Putting on muscle is a very slow process and not at all easy. It takes many years of hard, dedicated, and consistent work. It is not possible to become huge and muscular by accident. Unless you’re specifically training and eating to “be huge” for a very long time, you’re not going to reach that point.
If you find yourself starting to get bigger than you’d like, you can always stop adding weight and/or volume to prevent more gains, or stop working out entirely to reverse these effects.
