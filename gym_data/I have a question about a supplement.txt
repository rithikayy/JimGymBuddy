I have a question about a supplement…
Most questions about any supplement, such as:
What is this supplement?
What does it do?
Does it work?
Is it safe?
How do I take it?
Can be answered by looking up its ingredients on
Examine.com
, which aggregates and summarizes all of the most current scientific research about nutritional supplements. If Examine.com does not have a page for an ingredient, this may be a red flag and you should proceed with caution.
That being said, in general, most supplements are made primarily from one common ingredient:
marketing
– which is to say, they often do between very little and nothing, and are not a good use of your money.
