Squat jacks
are a high intensity variation of
jumping jacks
that combine the strength element of a bodyweight
squat
with the explosive power of a vertical. To perform squat jacks, jump the feet wide and lower into a squat position, then bring the feet back together with an explosive jump.
Squat jacks are a
cardio exercise
with a strength element, building lower body strength and muscular endurance whilst working on cardio fitness, power, and speed. Squat jacks work well as part of a warm up, in interval training, and in lower body workouts. The challenging combination of jumping and squatting elevates the heart rate and keeps the focus on the
legs
, making squat jacks a useful addition to a leg-day circuit.
Squat jacks are suitable for people with a good level of fitness and lower body strength. If you are new to jumping jacks or bodyweight squats, keep the tempo slow and do shorter intervals as you build your fitness and endurance. To increase the intensity of squat jacks, squat lower or increase the tempo.

Commonly Asked Questions About Squat Jacks
What Are The Benefits Of Squat Jacks?
Squat jacks are a type of jumping jack exercise that deliver a high-intensity cardiovascular workout whilst building lower body strength and power. They improve explosive leg strength, challenge balance and stability, and develop functional fitness through multi-planar movement.
Which Muscles Do Squat Jacks Work?
Squat jacks mostly work the lower body muscles through the squat and vertical jump movements. You will feel squat jumps in your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Other muscles are also worked in squat jacks, including the calves, abs and core, and adductors.
How Often Should I Include Squat Jacks In My Workout Routine?
Squat jacks are an intense cardio exercise but because they use bodyweight only, you could include them up to 3-4 times per week depending on your fitness levels and goals. Start with 3-4 sets of 20-30 seconds, and build up the time or reduce the rest period as you get fitter. Squat jacks work well in circuits, as part of a dynamic warm-up, or as a conditioning finisher.
What Are Alternatives To Squat Jacks?
Alternatives to squat jacks include jump squats or lateral squat jumps. For lower impact, try step-out squats or alternating side squats without jumping. Squat thrusts provide similar cardio benefits, and wide sumo squats work some of the same muscle groups.
