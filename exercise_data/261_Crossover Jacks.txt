Jump straight to instructions
Crossover jacks
are a dynamic variation of traditional
jumping jacks
. To perform crossover jacks, jump your feet out wide whilst extending your arms out at shoulder height, then jump to cross your feet underneath your body whilst crossing your arms in front of your chest, alternating which foot and arm crosses in front. This challenging movement adds complexity to the standard jumping jack, making it a good
cardio
progression that will work agility and
shoulder
strength while improving coordination.
When doing crossover jacks, keep your body upright posture and control the arm and leg movements to maintain good form. Crossover jacks can be done as part of a warm up to elevate the heart rate, or as high-intensity intervals in a circuit. They can also be used as part of a cardio sequence, or as an exercise to improve agility.
Start with short intervals of 20-30 seconds until you master the crossover movement, then increase duration. You can increase the intensity of crossover jacks by jumping faster.
