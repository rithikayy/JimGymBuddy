What Is A Tricep Push Up?
Jump straight to instructions
Tricep push ups
, also known as tricep press ups, are a push up variation that places more emphasis on the triceps, the muscles located on the back of your upper arms, by using different hand and arm positioning. The triceps are responsible for elbow extension and help to support some shoulder movements.
While traditional push ups mainly work the chest, with the shoulders and triceps worked as secondary muscles, tricep push ups primarily work the tricep brachii, with support from the shoulders and chest. The core is also engaged to maintain stability and control during the exercise.

Commonly Asked Questions On Tricep Push Ups
Are Tricep Push Ups Harder Than Regular Press Ups?
Tricep push ups are generally considered to be more challenging than standard push ups, because of the types of muscle they focus on. For many people, the triceps are usually weaker than the chest and shoulders, so, by targeting the muscles in the back of the arms more, the movement can be more demanding.
Do Tricep Push Ups Work The Chest?
Tricep push ups primarily target the triceps, but they do also engage the chest muscles (pectoralis major) to some extent as they play a role in stabilising your body during the exercise. So, while they may not be the main focus of this exercise, tricep push ups do still involve the chest muscles.
What Head Of The Tricep Do Push Ups Work?
Push ups, including tricep push ups, work all three heads of the triceps - long head, lateral head, and medial head. Since the primary action during a push up is elbow extension (straightening the arm), all parts of the triceps are activated. However, due to the narrow hand placement in tricep push ups, the emphasis is often placed on the lateral head of the triceps.
What’s The Difference Between A Tricep Press Up And A Modified Tricep Press Up?
The difference between these two variations lies in the body position and difficulty level:
● Tricep push up: Involves a full plank position on your toes with hands close together under your shoulders.
● Modified Tricep push up: Involves kneeling on the floor with hands in a similar position, making the exercise easier by reducing the amount of bodyweight lifted.
Tricep Push Up Tips
● Ensure your core is engaged and elbows stay close to your sides throughout the full movement.
● Perform tricep push ups with controlled movements rather than rushing through them. This helps engage the triceps effectively.
● Inhale as you lower your body and exhale as you push yourself back up. This rhythmic breathing can help you maintain control and energy throughout the exercise.
How To Do A Tricep Push Up
Start in a plank position with your hands positioned close together, directly under your shoulders. Your fingers should be pointing forward or slightly turned inward.
Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels, engaging your core muscles to maintain stability.
Lower your chest toward the floor while keeping your elbows close to your sides. Unlike traditional push ups where the elbows flare out to the sides, in tricep push ups, the elbows should stay close to your body.
Continue lowering your body until your chest is just above the ground or as far down as your strength allows.
Push back up to the starting position by extending your arms, again keeping your elbows close to your sides.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
How To Do A  Modified Tricep Push Up
Start by getting into a kneeling position on the floor. Kneel on a padded surface or use a yoga mat for comfort.
Place your hands on the floor in front of you, positioning them close together and directly under your shoulders. Your fingers should be pointing forward or slightly turned inward.
Keep your back straight and engage your core muscles to maintain a stable position.
Lower your upper body by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides. Unlike traditional push ups where the elbows flare out, in modified tricep push ups, they stay close to your body.
Continue lowering your chest toward the floor until your triceps are parallel to the ground or as far as your strength allows.
Push your upper body back up to the starting position by extending your arms, again keeping your elbows close to your sides.
Repeat for the desired number of reps.
