Back Exercises
Why is it important to train your back?
Jump straight to exercises
It's important to strengthen your back to help improve your functioning in daily activities and for performance in the gym or in sports. Some of the benefits of training your back include:
Improving posture.
Poor posture, particularly slumped shoulders, can be caused by tight chest muscles and weak back muscles. Strengthening the muscles in the back can help to improve your posture.
Prevent and reduce lower back pain.
Strengthening the back muscles helps to support and stabilise the spine which can reduce pressure on the lower back and reduce back pain.
Make daily activities easier.
The back muscles are used in lots of daily activities, from opening doors to picking things up off the floor. Strengthening these muscles makes your daily activities easier.
Reduces risk of injury.
Having a strong back makes it less likely you'll get injured, whether that's day to day or when working out.
When training it's important to consider training all muscle groups to avoid creating muscle imbalances.

Your back is the main support structure for your entire body. It plays a role in every compound movement we do. You can help reduce the risk of injury, as well as improve your posture by incorporating a back focused workout into your training. You'll also find everyday tasks much easier, such as having to bend down to pick something up off the floor.
