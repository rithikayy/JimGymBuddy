Side Lying Hip Adduction
What Is Side Lying Hip Adduction?
Jump straight to instructions
Side lying hip adduction
is a bodyweight exercise that strengthens the inner thigh muscles, including the adductor magnus, adductor longus, and gracilis. These muscles are often missed in compound leg day exercises, but they're important for stabilising the hips and generating power in pushing movements like
squats
and
leg press.
Doing side lying hip adduction allows you to isolate the adductor muscles and feel them working without needing weights. You can do bodyweight or banded lying hip adduction, making this a versatile exercise for the gym or home.
Compared to seated machine adduction exercises, the side lying variation targets the core as your body braces to stay stable. Added
core engagement
improves stability in the hips, glutes, and pelvis, which translates into lifting heavier weights with less injury risk.
Side lying hip adduction is suitable for all fitness levels, from beginners building a strong foundation to advanced athletes looking to balance their physique. To make the exercise more challenging, add a resistance band just above or below your knees. The simplicity of this exercise makes it a good choice for warm-ups, finishers, or for supersetting with other leg exercises.
