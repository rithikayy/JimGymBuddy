Chest Exercises
Why should I train my chest?
Jump straight to exercises
Your chest is made up of two muscles, the pectoralis major, and pectoralis minor. Together, these two muscles play an important part in many essential movements, including moving your arms across the body, sideways, up, and down.
Some of the benefits of training your chest include:
Improving functional fitness.
The chest muscles are involved in lots of everyday activities, like pushing heavy objects. Strengthening the chest muscles makes carrying out daily pushing actions easier.
Bigger upper body.
If you're training for aesthetics, building the chest muscles is a great way to build noticeable mass to look bigger.
Improved posture.
The chest muscles are connected to the ribs, and strengthening the chest can help improve posture by allowing the chest to stay high (rather than slumped).
It's important to avoid muscular imbalances by training all major muscle groups in the body.
