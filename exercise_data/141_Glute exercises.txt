Glute exercises
Why should you train your glutes?
Jump straight to exercises
Your gluteal muscles are made up of 3 muscles: the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. The gluteus maximus is the largest muscle group in the body, and primarily functions for hip extension, hip internal rotation and hip abduction, which you use in everyday movements such as, standing up from sitting, climbing stairs and holding yourself in standing position.
Improved performance
: With one of the largest muscles in your body, training your glutes will allow you to build overall strength and muscle, and in turn, can help to offset the rate of muscle loss and improve bone density.
Reduce risk of injury:
Instability in the hip can lead to excessive force in the ankles, knees and lower back, which can then lead to injury. Having strong glutes can help to create a more stable pelvis which can better support your lower back, knees and ankles.
Glute exercises are a staple to include in your exercise routine. Strengthen your lower body with the glute exercises below, ranging from hip thrusts and glute bridges.
