What are Jumping Jack Burpees?
Jump straight to instructions
Jumping jack burpees
are an intense
cardio
exercise that combines
jumping jacks
with the
plyometric
movement of
burpees
. To perform jumping jack burpees, lower into a burpee with a push-up, jump your feet towards your hands, then do a jumping jack before lowering back into the next burpee. This challenging movement creates a high-intensity
full body exercise
that burns calories and builds cardiovascular fitness.
Jumping jack burpees are more intense than a burpee, with the addition of the jumping jack adding explosive power and complexity to the movement. The exercise combines power, strength, and endurance training in one sequence, making it a good choice for burning calories, raising the heart rate, and improving athletic performance.
When performing jumping jack burpees, maintain control in each phase by keeping your core engaged and land softly during the jumping jack. This exercise is best for people who have mastered standard burpees and jumping jacks separately. If you are new to burpee jumping jacks, slow the movement down and do short sets with longer rest periods.
Jumping jack burpees can be incorporated into
cardio
workouts or used as a challenging finisher. Start with short intervals of 30 seconds or sets of 5-8 reps, gradually increasing as you build endurance.

Commonly Asked Questions About Jumping Jack Burpees
What Are The Benefits Of Jumping Jack Burpees?
Jumping jack burpees are a great exercise for intense cardio conditioning that will improve fitness and recovery capacity. The combination of burpee and jumping jack makes this a full body strength and power movement that improves muscular endurance, explosive power, and agility whilst maximising calorie burn.
Which Muscles Do Jumping Jack Burpees Work?
Jumping jack burpees work nearly every major muscle group. The burpee portion works the chest, shoulders, and triceps during the push-up, and the abs core and lower back. The jumping movement works the quads, hamstrings, calves, and lateral hip muscles. This exercise challenges the core by moving through multiple planes of movement.
How Often Should I Include Jumping Jack Burpees In My Workout Routine?
Include jumping jack burpees 1-2 times per week in high-intensity cardio workouts. Do 2-3 sets of 30 seconds or 6-10 repetitions, resting between sets to maintain good form. Jumping jack burpees are most effective when used in short, intense bursts rather than long sets.
What Are Alternatives To Jumping Jack Burpees?
Effective alternatives to jumping jack burpees include standard burpees touching your hands overhead as you stand up. For lower impact, try walkout burpees followed by step jacks, or squat thrusts combined with alternating side steps.
