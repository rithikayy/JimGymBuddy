What Are Single Unders?
Jump straight to instructions
Single unders
are the most common variation of skipping exercise, where the rope passes under your feet once per jump. This classic jump rope movement involves a low rhythmic jump motion whilst rotating the rope with relaxed wrist movements.
Skipping
is great for burning calories, strengthening the
cardiovascular
system, and improving lower body endurance and agility. Practicing single under skips is a great way to add some
cardio
to your gym routines, or to build the fitness and timing needed for more challenging skip variations.
Unlike more complex variations like double unders or crossovers, single unders focus on establishing rhythm and maintaining consistent motion. The low-impact nature of single unders means they are suitable for beginners whilst offering benefits to advanced athletes.
When performing single unders, maintain an upright posture with a slight bend in your knees, keeping jumps small and controlled. The rope should skim the ground with each rotation, creating a steady tempo. Single unders can be modified by adjusting speed or duration as you get fitter.
Single unders are versatile enough to incorporate into various workouts. They work well as a warm-up activity, between strength exercises, or as part of a cardio session. Start with intervals of 30-60 seconds, gradually increasing as your endurance improves. For beginners, focus on maintaining form and consistent rhythm before increasing speed or attempting more complex variations.

Commonly Asked Questions About Single Unders
What Are The Benefits Of Single Unders?
Single unders are a great way to burn calories and build cardiovascular fitness with minimal impact on joints. The jumping motion will develop bone density and help maintain healthy heart and lung function. Regular single under practice also improves balance, agility, and overall endurance.
Which Muscles Do Single Unders Work?
Single unders work the calves, quads, and hamstrings through the jumping motion. The core muscles work to maintain stability and posture, and the shoulders, forearms, and wrists work to turn the rope. Muscles of the posterior chain, including the glutes and lower back, provide stability throughout the movement. Single unders even work smaller stabilising muscles in the ankles and feet.
How Often Should I Include Single Unders In My Workout Routine?
You could do single unders 3-4 times per week, either as a 5-10 minute warm-up or as part of your cardio sessions. Start with intervals of 30-60 seconds, taking short breaks between sets. If you’re new to jump rope exercises, practice 3-5 times a week for shorter durations to build technique and endurance. Be sure to take days off from single unders to avoid muscle soreness.
What Are Alternatives To Single Unders?
Alternatives to single unders include jumping jacks, mountain climbers, or high knees which will all give you similar cardiovascular benefits. Lateral hops can help develop foot speed in a similar way to single unders. Jumping without a rope helps build the basic movement pattern. Box jumps or jump squats will work lower body conditioning and power.
Single Unders Tips
Practice the steady jumping rhythm without a rope.
Start by doing short timed intervals to build technique.
Keep your arms relaxed, elbows close to your sides.
Keep both feet together and toes pointing down as you jump.
Land on the balls of your feet with soft knees.
How To Do Single Unders
Hold one end of the rope in each hand and stand with feet together in front of the rope.
Start by turning the rope in an arc above your head.
As the rope comes down in front of your body, jump both feet 1-2 inches off the floor.
Let the rope pass under your feet, and keep it turning as you jump in rhythm.
