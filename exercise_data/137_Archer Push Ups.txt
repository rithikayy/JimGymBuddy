What Is An Archer Push Up?
Jump straight to instructions
Archer push ups, a challenging bodyweight exercise, are a dynamic variation of traditional push ups that target multiple muscle groups while helping to build strength and improve stability. This challenging movement involves dropping your chest to the floor while shifting your body from side to side, engaging each arm in turn. Every time your chest is dropped, your body should form a similar shape to an archer with their bow flexed.
Not only do archer push ups effectively target the chest, shoulders, and triceps, they also engage the core and improve overall upper body strength and endurance. As you shift your weight from side to side, the unilateral nature of the exercise also helps to address muscle imbalances.
Archer push ups offer a demanding alternative to standard push ups, providing a new challenge for those seeking to diversify their workout routine.
As part of the push up family, archer push ups share similarities with one-arm push ups, making them an excellent addition to any bodyweight training regimen.

Commonly Asked Questions On Archer Push Ups
What Muscles Do Archer Push Ups Work?
Archer push ups engage multiple  muscles, making them a comprehensive upper-body exercise. The primary muscle groups targeted include:
Chest
: The pectoralis major is heavily activated during archer push ups, especially on the side where the arm is extended
Shoulders
: Both the anterior and lateral deltoids are engaged to stabilise the shoulder joints during the movement
Triceps
: The triceps brachii, located on the back of the arms, play a significant role in extending the elbow during the pushing phase
Core Muscles
: To maintain a stable body position, the rectus abdominis, obliques, and transverse abdominis are activated throughout the exercise
Serratus Anterio
r: This muscle, located on the sides of the ribcage, is involved in protracting and stabilising the shoulder blades
Do Archer Push Ups Build Muscle?
Yes, archer push ups can contribute to muscle growth, especially in the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Consistent practice and progressive overload, along with a focused diet are key to seeing muscle-building results.
Archer Push Up Tips
Ensure a straight body line from head to heels, keeping the core engaged throughout the movement.
Control the descent and ascent to maximise muscle engagement and reduce the risk of injury.
Start with a manageable range of motion and gradually increase it as strength improves.
Shift your weight smoothly from one side to the other, distributing the load evenly between both arms.
How To Do Archer Push Ups
Begin in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
While shifting your weight to the left-hand side and without moving your hands, start to drop your chest until it touches the floor, bending your left elbow and straightening your right arm as you drop down. Your chest should be resting next to your bent left arm, with your right arm staying extended.
Pushing through your left hand, straighten your left arm to return to the starting position.
Repeat the movement on the right-hand side, alternating sides with each repetition.
